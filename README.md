👋

I am Antonio! I went from painter 🎨 to web developer 👩‍💻, deciding to change the canvas for the screen. Although I miss the feel of a canvas, I'm thrilled to create something new and exciting with every line of code I write.

This is my GitHub where I share my projects so you can take a look to my code.

My favourite project is a SPA for people to sign in and share their music instrument alias and characteristics: [Be-Euphonium Network](https://beeuphonium.netlify.app/). Users can add/edit and remove the item of their music instruments collection. You can take a look to the code in my repositories [Be-Euphonium_front](https://github.com/AntonioJRuizG/Be-Euphonium_front) and [Be-Euphonium_back](https://github.com/AntonioJRuizG/Be-Euphonium_back).
